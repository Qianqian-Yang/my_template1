## Highlights:

1. Global air quality change during the COVID-19 were analyzed comprehensively.
2. The PM2.5, PM10, dropped by around 20% and NO2 dropped by 30% during the COVID-19.
3. The changes of O3, SO2, and CO had spatial heterogeneity.
4. Extent of human activities impact on air quality varied with response speed of city.

## Abstracts: 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rare reduction in human activities. In such a background, data from ground-based environmental stations, satellites, and reanalysis materials are utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the global air quality changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results showed that under the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, a significant decrease in particulate matter (PMx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) occurred in more than 40% of the world's land area, with NO2 (PMx) decreasing by nearly 30% (nearly 20%). The mobility, meteorological factors, and the response speed to COVID-19 outbreaks were examined. It was further found that in quick-response cities, lockdowns produced a sharp decline in mobility and had a dominant impact on air quality. In contrast, in slow-response cities, mobility dropped gradually since the confirmation of the first COVID-19 case (FCC) and he impact of the FCC, lockdowns, and meteorological factors were comparable.

## Conclusions: 
Industrial development has been accused of being the primary cause of air pollution in the past several decades. The breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a special test foundation to investigate the relationship between them. In this study, multisource data were utilized to quantify the air quality changes and the impacts of COVID-19 FCCs and lockdowns on air quality changes. The results showed that the COVID-19-related human activity slowdowns resulted in the greatest reduction in NO2 pollution, which dropped by approximately 30% since the COVID-19 breakout on the global scale. Then the PM2.5 and PM10.

Most cities witnessed a percentage decline of approximately 20%, except for cities in Europe. Unfavorable meteorological conditions since the end of March in European cities offset the influence of the lockdowns. The changes in O3, SO2, and CO pollution were not as obvious as for PMx and NO2, but indications of ozone enhancement and CO decreases were seen in some areas. While most current studies have focused only on the impact of lockdowns and have concluded that lockdowns are followed by air quality improvements, this study found that this was not always the case. In those cities with a relatively quick responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of lockdowns on air quality was typically significant, but for the slow-response cities, the effect of FCCs and meteorological parameters on air quality was found also to be important.

Our study reveals the interactions between air pollution and human activities with meteorology considered and deepens our understanding on pollution formation and control. But there are also some limitations. The used reanalysis data can contain uncertainties since the emission inventories were not updated in a timely manner. In the future, we will pay more attention to the satellite retrieved PM2.5 and PM10 product and the reconstructed full-coverage satellites product. In addition, many studies have tried to investigate the relationships between meteorology and air quality change during COVID-19 pandemic through introducing model simulations or complex statistical models (Yang et al 2020). In our study, we eliminate the impact of periodic intra-year meteorological changes through calculating the anomalies. And the impact of inter-annual meteorological variations was analyzed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. Introducing a more rigorous and accurate model for a further research is worthy of attention. Finally, as some studies have proposed (Diffenbaugh et al 2020, Gillingham et al 2020), COVID-19 can have a long-run impact on the earth system. In the future, long-term and continuous observations will be collected for a further exploration.
