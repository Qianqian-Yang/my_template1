The report introduce the [CasRF_based downscaling models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620339329) and [dual-scale retrieval methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271620301441) for the PM2.5 retrieval at a ultrahigh-spatial-resolution. Both these two methods achieves the PM2.5 mapping at 300m with a high accuracy.
Besides, this report also introduces the work about [global air quality change during COVID-19 outbreak](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1012/meta).
