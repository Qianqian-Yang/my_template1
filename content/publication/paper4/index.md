abstract: PM2.5 pollution is caused by multiple factors and determining how these factors affect PM2.5 pollution is important for haze control. In this study, we modified the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and investigated the relationships between PM2.5 and its influencing factors. Experiments covering 368 cities and 9 urban agglomerations were conducted in China in 2015 and more than 20 factors were considered. The modified GWR coefficients (MGCs) were calculated for six variables, including two emission factors (SO2 and NO2 concentrations), two meteorological factors (relative humidity and lifted index), and two topographical factors (woodland percentage and elevation). Then the spatial distribution of MGCs was analyzed at city, cluster, and region scales. Results showed that the relationships between PM2.5 and the different factors varied with location. SO2 emission positively affected PM2.5, and the impact was the strongest in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region. The impact of NO2 was generally smaller than that of SO2 and could be important in coastal areas. The impact of meteorological factors on PM2.5 was complicated in terms of spatial variations, with relative humidity and lifted index exerting a strong positive impact on PM2.5 in Pearl River Delta and Central China, respectively. Woodland percentage mainly influenced PM2.5 in regions of or near deserts, and elevation was important in BTH and Sichuan. The findings of this study can improve our understanding of haze formation and provide useful information for policy-making.
